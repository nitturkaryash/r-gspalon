# Error Handling Improvements

This document outlines the error handling improvements implemented in the R&G Salon Management System.

## ErrorBoundary Component

The `ErrorBoundary` component is a class-based React component that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in its child component tree. It provides a fallback UI when an error occurs, preventing the entire application from crashing.

Key features:
- Catches errors in component rendering, lifecycle methods, and event handlers
- Displays a user-friendly error message
- Provides options to navigate back to the dashboard or reload the page
- Logs errors to the console for debugging

Implementation:
- Located at `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`
- Applied at multiple levels in the application:
  - At the root level in `main.tsx` to catch application-wide errors
  - Around the Routes component in `App.tsx` to catch routing-related errors

## Supabase Error Handling

Enhanced error handling for Supabase database operations ensures that errors are properly caught, logged, and reported to the user.

Key improvements:
- Detailed error messages with context about the operation that failed
- Proper error propagation to allow upstream components to handle errors
- Consistent error handling patterns across all database operations
- Improved recovery from non-critical errors

Implementation:
- Enhanced `directSqlExecution.ts` with more detailed error messages
- Updated `setupInventoryTables.ts` to distinguish between critical and non-critical errors
- Added comprehensive error logging throughout Supabase utilities

## Debugging Utilities

A set of utilities for diagnosing Supabase connection issues and table accessibility.

Key features:
- `checkSupabaseConnection`: Verifies the connection to Supabase
- `checkSupabaseAuth`: Checks authentication status
- `debugSupabase`: Comprehensive diagnostic tool that checks connection, authentication, and table accessibility

Implementation:
- Located at `src/utils/supabase/debugSupabase.ts`
- Integrated into the InventorySetup page for easy access

## Loading State Management

Proper handling of loading states for all asynchronous operations ensures that users are informed about the progress of operations.

Key improvements:
- Loading indicators for all asynchronous operations
- Disabled buttons during loading to prevent duplicate submissions
- Fallback UI during initial data loading
- React Suspense integration for code splitting

Implementation:
- Added loading state handling in the InventorySetup page
- Implemented proper loading indicators in the Inventory page
- Added Suspense boundaries in App.tsx

## Toast Notifications

User-friendly notifications for success and error states provide immediate feedback to users.

Key features:
- Success notifications for completed operations
- Error notifications with actionable information
- Warning notifications for potential issues
- Consistent styling and positioning

Implementation:
- Replaced alert() calls with toast notifications
- Added toast notifications for all major operations
- Configured ToastContainer in main.tsx for consistent styling
