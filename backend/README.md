# Salon Stock Management System

This backend system enables salon managers to extract data from Excel-based stock records and manage product inventory efficiently. It also includes a feature to reclassify cash sales as salon consumption.

## Features

### 1. Stock Data Extraction

- Automatically processes Excel files containing stock details
- Handles complex multi-header structures 
- Processes four main sections: Purchases, Sales, Consumption, and Balance Stock
- Standardizes unit codes (e.g., BTL-BOTTLES â†’ BTL)
- Fixes floating-point errors in numeric calculations

### 2. Cash-to-Consumption Conversion

- Allows reclassification of cash sales transactions as salon consumption
- Maintains inventory accuracy while providing tax optimization (where legally permitted)
- Tracks original transaction data for audit purposes
- Handles batch conversion of multiple transactions

## Database Schema

The system uses a MySQL database with the following structure:

- **Products**: Core product information (name, HSN code, unit)
- **Purchases**: Records of stock acquired by the salon
- **Sales**: Records of products sold to customers
- **Consumption**: Records of products used internally by the salon
- **Balance Stock**: Current inventory levels

## Security Considerations

- Implement proper authentication before deploying in production
- Validate all file uploads to prevent security vulnerabilities
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Ensure proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information

## Legal Note

The cash-to-consumption conversion feature assumes compliance with local tax laws. Converting sales to consumption to avoid tax should only be done if legally permitted in your jurisdiction. Consult with a tax professional before using this feature.
