# Product Management Integration to Inventory Section

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to integrate product management directly into the Inventory section of the R&G Salon application, as requested. The standalone Products section has been removed, and product management has been consolidated into the Inventory workflow.

## Key Changes

### 1. Inventory Purchase Tab Enhancement

The Purchase tab in the Inventory section has been enhanced to facilitate product management:

- Added autocomplete for product name selection from existing products
- Modified the form to simultaneously add products to the product catalog when recording purchases
- Updated the UI to better indicate that this tab serves dual functionality for purchase recording and product management
- Added checks to verify if a product exists before creating a new one

**Code Implementation:**
```typescript
// In PurchaseTab.tsx
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  if (!validateForm()) return;
  
  try {
    // First check if product exists in product catalog
    if (!productExists(formState.product_name)) {
      // Add new product to catalog
      await addProductToCatalog({
        name: formState.product_name,
        hsn_code: formState.hsn_code,
        units: formState.units,
        price: formState.mrp_incl_gst,
      });
    }
    
    // Create purchase record
    await createPurchase(formState);
    
    // Reset form on success
    setFormState({
      // Reset form fields
    });
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
  }
};
```

### 2. POS System Integration for Salon Consumption

Updated the POS system to include salon consumption tracking:

- Added a "Mark as Salon Consumption" checkbox for each product in the order list
- Modified the order creation workflow to handle product items marked for salon consumption
- Added a mechanism to route consumed products to the inventory consumption table instead of sales
- Enhanced the `OrderItem` interface to include the `salonConsumption` property

**Example Implementation:**
```typescript
// In the OrderItem interface
interface OrderItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
  salonConsumption: boolean; // New property
}

// In order processing logic
const processOrder = async (order) => {
  for (const item of order.items) {
    if (item.salonConsumption) {
      // Record as salon consumption
      await recordConsumption({
        product_name: item.name,
        consumption_qty: item.quantity,
        // Other consumption details
      });
    } else {
      // Record as regular sale
      await recordSale({
        product_name: item.name,
        sales_qty: item.quantity,
        // Other sale details
      });
    }
  }
};
```

### 3. Consumption Tab Enhancement

Updated the Consumption tab in the Inventory section to better display salon consumption items:

- Added visual indicators for consumption items that originated from POS
- Added informational guidance about the salon consumption feature
- Updated the UI to display POS-originated consumption items with a special tag

**Code Example:**
```tsx
// In ConsumptionTab.tsx
// Add guidance about salon consumption feature
<Paper sx={{ p: 2, mb: 3, backgroundColor: 'info.light', color: 'info.dark' }}>
  <Box sx={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center' }}>
    <InfoIcon sx={{ mr: 1 }} />
    <Typography variant="body2">
      Products marked as "Salon Consumption" in the POS system are now recorded here. 
      Use the checkbox in POS when selling a product for salon use instead of customer sale.
    </Typography>
  </Box>
</Paper>

// Display indicator for POS-originated items
{consumption.source === 'pos' && (
  <Chip 
    size="small" 
    color="primary" 
    label="From POS" 
    sx={{ ml: 1 }} 
  />
)}
```

### 4. Database Schema Updates

Created a comprehensive database schema that includes:

- A dedicated products table (`inventory_products`)
- Database triggers to update product stock when:
  - New purchases are recorded (increases stock)
  - Sales are made through POS (decreases stock)
  - Salon consumption is recorded (decreases stock)
- Integration between the inventory tables to maintain accurate stock counts

**SQL Schema:**
```sql
-- Products table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS inventory_products (
  product_id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  product_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  hsn_code TEXT,
  units TEXT,
  mrp_incl_gst NUMERIC NOT NULL,
  mrp_excl_gst NUMERIC,
  stock_quantity NUMERIC DEFAULT 0,
  gst_percentage NUMERIC DEFAULT 0,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);

-- Trigger to update product stock on purchase
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_product_stock_on_purchase() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Update existing product or create new one
  INSERT INTO inventory_products (product_name, hsn_code, units, mrp_incl_gst, stock_quantity)
  VALUES (NEW.product_name, NEW.hsn_code, NEW.units, NEW.mrp_incl_gst, NEW.purchase_qty)
  ON CONFLICT (product_name) DO UPDATE
  SET stock_quantity = inventory_products.stock_quantity + NEW.purchase_qty,
      updated_at = now();
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### 5. Navigation and Routing Updates

Streamlined the application navigation:

- Removed the standalone Products and Product Setup menu items from the navigation menu
- Removed the corresponding routes from App.tsx
- Consolidated all product-related functionality into the Inventory section

## New Workflow

### Adding Products

1. Navigate to the Inventory section
2. In the Purchases tab, record a new purchase:
   - Enter product details (name, HSN code, units, etc.)
   - If the product doesn't exist in the catalog, it will be automatically added
   - If the product exists, its stock will be updated

### Using Products in POS

1. Navigate to the POS section
2. Add products to the order as needed
3. For products used by the salon (not sold to customers), check the "Mark as Salon Consumption" checkbox
4. Complete the order:
   - Regular products will be recorded in the Sales tab of Inventory
   - Products marked for salon consumption will be recorded in the Consumption tab

### Tracking Inventory

1. Navigate to the Inventory section
2. Use the respective tabs to view:
   - Purchases: All product purchases with quantities and values
   - Sales: Products sold to customers through POS
   - Consumption: Products used by the salon, including those marked in POS

## Database Synchronization

The system now maintains accurate stock counts by:

1. Increasing stock when purchases are recorded
2. Decreasing stock when products are sold to customers
3. Decreasing stock when products are consumed by the salon

## Technical Implementation

The implementation involved modifications to several key components:

- `PurchaseTab.tsx`: Enhanced to manage products during purchase recording
- `POS.tsx`: Updated to include salon consumption checkbox and logic
- `ConsumptionTab.tsx`: Enhanced to display salon consumption items
- `inventory_tables.sql`: Updated with product table schema and triggers
- `Layout.tsx`: Simplified navigation by removing Products section
- `App.tsx`: Updated routing by removing Product routes
